/**
 * Apply a public key to encrypt/decrypt data directly. Note that you should NOTE use this for anything sizable, since
 * it's MUCH slower than symmetric encryption.
 *
 * Also note that there are three possibilities for the key that is provided in the constructor:
 * 1. None: No encryption will be performed and no decryption is possible
 * 2. Some(key id associated only with a public key): It will be possible to encrypt data, but decryption will throw an
 * Exception.
 * 3. Some(key id associated with both public and private key): Encryption and decryption should work correctly.
